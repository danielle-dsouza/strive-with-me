        A grassroots initiative focused on helping young adults and their families.
      </p>
      <p>Maria Le spent many years searching for services to help
        her eldest daughter, diagnosed with autism.
        Unfortuntely, she realized many services were either out of area
        or were not suitable. She was disappointed that there seemed to be a lack of programs for those who are on the
        Spectrum and are transitioning from highschool to post-secondary and/or employment. </p>
      <p>
        Her youngest daughter has been dealing with depression and anxiety for several years.
        Although she plays team sports and is in the mainstream school program, Maria noticed her daughter struggled
        with the sociatal stigmatization of Mental Health.
      </p>
      <p>She decided she wanted to help not just her daughters, but the many other young adults who face such
        difficulties, as well.</p>
